Once the plugin has finished scanning the image, the report seen in Jenkins should be also available in Sysdig Secure.

For each image that has been scanned, thereâ€™s an entry in Image Scanning > Repositories.

Click in the image and you will see all the information about the scan.

All the information about what did not succeed from the policy applied:

Operating System (base image) vulnerabilities:

![OS vulnerabilities](/sysdig/scenarios/monitor-lab07/assets/image24.png)

But we can see as well application vulnerabilities, because since we have the full report of CVEs, we can scan also the libraries that our programs include:
