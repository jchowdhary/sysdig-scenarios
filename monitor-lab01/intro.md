In this scenario we will deploy an example microservice voting app in Kubernetes that issues votes for your favourite: dogs or cats. Results are stored in a database and then a report can be generated with the results. 

Suddenly there is more people voting using our application and the app becomes slower and slower. In this lab we will find the microservices bottleneck and check how we can scale this application to handle the required load.
