As before we need to make our slaves accessible to incoming requests. This is done by starting a service which knows how to communicate with _redis-slave_.

Because we have two replicated pods the service will also provide load balancing between the two nodes.

####Â Start Redis Slave Service

`kubectl create -f redis-slave-service.yaml`{{execute}}

`kubectl get services`{{execute}}
