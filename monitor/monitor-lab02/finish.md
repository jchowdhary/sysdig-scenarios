During this lab we have seen how Sysdig Monitor provides deep visibility into your containerized infrastructure and out of the box allows to:

- Explore the containerized infrastructure and a microservices applications.
- Monitor a web services application. Key metrics and monitoring approaches:
  - Golden signals and application metrics monitoring
  - USE resource and container limits monitoring
  - Kubernetes orchestration and kube-state-metrics monitoring
  - SQL errors, average and maximum latency, most common and slowest requests
- Unequivocally correlate Kubernetes events with degraded service metrics
- Follow an SQL conversation down to the syscall level of detail, inspecting the specific pod interaction that triggered the error.
